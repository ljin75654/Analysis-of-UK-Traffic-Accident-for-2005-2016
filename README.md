Topic: Analysis of UK Traffic Accidents (2005-2016)

Source Data: https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles

The Kaggle site provides 2 csv files. The first is an Accident Information file and the second is Vehicle Information. The Accident_Index variable is shared for both datasets. The Vehicle Information csv includes year 2004 data, and duplicates the Accident_Index variable for accidents with more than 1 vehicle involved.

This project was completed using python in a jupyter notebook file. The jupyter notebook file requires Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib packages.

This project is focused on analyzing the correlation between individual factors, and RTA casualties and vehicle involvement. The objective of this analysis is to identify two major factors tied to high casualty and vehicle involvement rates in the UK from 2005 to 2016.
